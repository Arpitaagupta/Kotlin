  DATA CLASS
-->A data class is just like a regular class that holds some data.

-->When we develop android application, a lot of time we will need classes that will not perform any operation,
    will hold lots of data.
     for such cases, we convert normal class to data class.

    1. Data Classes are used to store data
    2. they help us perform operations directly on the data stored in the objects of a class
    3. they help us in omitting redundant code
    4. a primary constructor of a data class must always have at least one parameter
